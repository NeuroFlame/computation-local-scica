### Computation Description for `spatially constrained ICA` (a.k.a NeuroMark ICA)

#### Overview
Spatially constrained ICA with NeuroMark utilizes a joint optimization for independence
and adherence of spatial constraints to a given template, allowing for the identification
of spatially independent components that align well with previously idenfitied networks.

For more information see the original paper from [Du et al. 2020.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158220302126)

This computation is designed to run in a federated learning environment; however,
all computation operations are currently local as spatially constrained ICA can
run on individual participants without sharing information between sites. 

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The computation locates nifti files stored in the input data directory, by searching for any 
        files which match the pattern `*.nii*` 
   - The computation resolves the template argument to either use a preset template included within
        GIFT, or to use a template hosted on the local filesystem. 

2. **Local Spatially Constrained ICA**:
   - Local spatially constrained ICA is then performed using the given template and locally specified
        parameters. This computation bundles all local steps for spatially constrained ICA into one
        pipeline managed by Nipype and GIFT, including masking, variance or mean removal, local
        scica optimization, static FNC computation, and report generation.

3. **Results**:
    - Results consist of a number of .mat MATLAB binary files, as well as an HTML report and PNG files
        which are contained within that report:
        * `gica_cmd_gica_batch.m` - a MATLAB script which contains all of the parameters for the local run
        * `gica_cmdMask.nii` - the MASK file generated or copied from an existing file
        * `gica_cmd_ica_br#.mat` - a MATLAB binary file which contains a single variable:
            - `compSet` which is a MATLAB struct with two fields:
                - `ic` - the set of (masked) spatially independent components with size 
                - `tc` - the set of time-series associated with each component with size
                This file contains the variables as they are created after back-reconstruction.
                One file will be generated for each local participant.
        * `gica_cmd_ica_c1.mat` - a MATLAB binary file which contains two variables:
            - `ic` - the set of (masked) spatially independent components with size

            This file is generated following the calibration step in GIFT, which comes after back-reconstruction
        *  `gica_cmd_ica_parameter_info.mat` - a MATLAB binary file which contains the GIFT parameters used in the the analysis. The file contains a single variable:

        * `gica_cmd_mean_component_ica_s1_.nii` - this NIFTI file contains the unmasked mean spatially indepdent components aggregated across the first session. This will be the same as the previous variable if there is only one session.

        * `gica_cmd_mean_timecourses_ica_s1_.nii` - this NIFTI file contains the mean time courses for each component aggregated across the first session. This will be the same as the previous variable if there is only one session.

#### Data Format Specification

The computation requires at minimum one valid NIFTI (.nii or .nii.gz) file located in the TOP LEVEL of the input folder, as well
as a parameters.json file with the local parameters for the computation. 

NIFTI files must contain a valid functional MRI image, i.e. which has 4 dimensions (X,Y,Z,Time) and which is 
readable using the GIFT toolbox. Corrupt or invalid MRI images will cause an error to be thrown in GIFT.

In the future, computations may require BIDS formatting of input data; however, currently that is not required. 

Currently, `parameters.json` is considered a local file, so each site can specify slightly different parameters if they desire; however, in most cases, these will be uniform across sites. The allowed parameters and types are as follows:

| Variable Name | Type | Description | Allowed Options | Default |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| `refFiles` | string | The template used as reference for spatially constrained ICA. | Any of the existing templates in GIFT can be specified just by providing the name of the template, with the most commonly used templates being `Neuromark_fMRI_1.0` and `Neuromark_fMRI_2.0`. Additionally a path to a locally provided template can be used, as long as the path is provided in terms of the docker image filesystem |
| `preproc_type` | integer | The type of subject-specific additional preprocessing to do prior to running ICA. | TBD | 1 | 
| `scaleType` | integer | The type of scaling to apply to components prior to saving. | TBD | 0 | 
| `mask` | string | To have GIFT automatically compute masks, use either the `default` or `default&icv` functions, which compute a mask based on the mean fMRI image (with the ICV image removing eyes); however, these will compute masks locally and may thus differ slightly between sites. A path to a NIFTI file may be provided as long as it is accessible to the computation. The path must be specified in terms of the docker filesystem. | default&ICV |
| `TR` | list<float> | The repetition time for each scan as a list of list of floats | List of floats, where the number of TRs is either 1 or equal to the number of subjects | [2] |
| `perfType` | int | the type of performance mode to use in GIFT | | 1 |
| `dummy_scans`| list<int> | the number of scans to remove from each participant | a list of integers, either one integer which is applied to all subjects, or a list with a number equal to the number of subjects | [0] |
| `prefix` | string | the prefix to append to filenames prior to saving | any valid character string | "gica_cmd" |

#### Assumptions

For now, it is assumed that each site has NIFTI files located at the TOP LEVEL of their data folder, and that all subjects ought to be included in the analysis. ALL .NIFTI files at the top level of the folder will be included.

It is assumed that standard preprocessing (warping, smoothing ,slice-timing ,etc) has been performed on all data prior to running ICA.

It is assumed that each site has their own set of parameters and will agree on a set of parameters that will allow for data sharing at subsequent stages if desirable. In the future some options may be moved to the server to configure them globally.

#### Example

```
{
    "refFiles": "Neuromark_fMRI_1.0",
    "preproc_type": 1,
    "scaleType": 0,
    "mask": "default&icv",
    "TR": [2],
    "perfType": 1,
    "dummy_scans": [0],
    "prefix": "gica_cmd"
}
```

# TODO

* Discuss requirement of BIDS formatting for input data and change computation to use a BIDS parser for more robust data parsing.
* Discuss sharing of local results and manual merging to create an aggregate result if desired.
